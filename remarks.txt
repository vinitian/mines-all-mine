1. added gradient background to global css
2. built room setting page (based from the figma styling at the time but not accurate to the figma styling yet)
3. built game page with corresponding map size (playable. still not turn based.)
Question: is drop down 6,8,10 enough or do we need more? input number?
4. adjust game cell color to white
5. deleted game play from home
